# Authentication

With the default options, the module requires a log-in page and a confirm page to handle the [PKCE authorization code flow](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/resources/glossary#pkce). If you want to understand how it works under the hood, you can read this [section](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side-rendering#understanding-the-authentication-flow).

All you need to do is to create a `login.vue` and `confirm.vue` page in the `pages` folder.

::alert{type="info"}
For advanced users who want to implement the auth behaviour themselves, you can disable or override the [redirect options](/get-started#redirect).
::

## Log-in page - `/login`

Each time a user is trying to access a page that needs authentication, he will automatically be redirected to the configured log in page. If you want to allow access to "public" page, you just need to add them in the [exclude](/get-started#redirectoptions) redirect option. 


::alert{type="warning"}
Ensure to activate the authentication providers you want in the Supabase Dashboard under `Authentication -> Providers`.
::

The log-in page initiates the log-in method(s) you choose from the [available authorization methods](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithpassword) provided by Supabase, it could looks like:

```vue [pages/login.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const supabase = useSupabaseClient()
const email = ref('')

const signInWithOtp = async () => {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({
    email: email.value,
    options: {
      emailRedirectTo: 'http://localhost:3000/confirm',
    }
  })
  if (error) console.log(error)
}
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="signInWithOtp">
      Sign In with E-Mail
    </button>
    <input
      v-model="email"
      type="email"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

Once the authorization flow is triggered using the `auth` wrapper of the [useSupabaseClient](/usage/composables/usesupabaseclient) composable, the session management is handled automatically and the user will be redirected to the page you specify in the redirect option (`/confirm` by default).

## Confirm page - `/confirm`

The confirmation page receives the supabase callback. From there you can check the user value and redirect to the appropriate page.

::alert{}
The redirect URL must be configured in your Supabase dashboard under `Authentication -> URL Configuration -> Redirect URLs`.
::


```vue [pages/confirm.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const user = useSupabaseUser()
watch(user, () => {
  if (user.value) {
    return navigateTo('/')
  }
}, { immediate: true })

</script>
<template>
  <div>Waiting for login...</div>
</template>
```
